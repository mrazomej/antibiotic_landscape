Our ability to experimentally track evolving microbial populations presents an
unprecedented opportunity to better understand the complexity of the space in
which evolutionary dynamics take place. The recent wave of work following the
strategy of determining the fitness of multiple genotypes not in one, but
multiple environments [@kinsler2020; @iwasawa2022; @ascensao2023; @ghosh2025]
suggests that this is a powerful approach to try to uncover the underlying
structure of the genotype-phenotype-fitness map. Combined with the body of
theoretical work suggesting that the genotype-phenotype map is
low-dimensional---meaning that a large number of genotypes result in a small
number of distinct phenotypes [@kaneko2015; @louis2016; @furusawa2018;
@russo2025b]---there is hope that we can leverage these large-scale datasets to
uncover features of the phenotypic space underlying adaptation in a data-driven
way.

The main approach taken so far towards this goal has been to use linear
decompositions of the fitness data to identify the principal components of
phenotypic variation [@kinsler2020; @iwasawa2022; @petti2023; @ghosh2025]. The
simplicity of these linear models comes at the cost of ignoring potentially
important nonlinearities in the genotype-phenotype-fitness map. Applying these
linear models to data generated from highly nonlinear processes can lead to
misleading interpretations of the underlying dimensionality and structure of the
phenotypic space, as revealed by embedding theorems from differential geometry
(see Supplementary Material for a detailed discussion). In this work, we take a
step towards removing this limitation by proposing a nonlinear dimensionality
reduction method that can capture the underlying nonlinear structure of the
phenotype-fitness map. We take advantage of recent advances in geometry-informed
variational autoencoders [@arvanitidis2018; @hauberg2019; @chadebec2020] to
learn a low-dimensional latent space built from high-dimensional fitness
measurements. We demonstrate the ability of our method to recover the underlying
nonlinear structure of the phenotype-fitness map on synthetic data generated
from evolutionary dynamics on a simple phenotypic space with nonlinear mapping
to fitness. The geometry-informed latent space not only recovers the relative
position of genotypes in the phenotypic space, but also, the learned function
mapping from latent coordinates to fitness is able to reconstruct the topography
of the underlying fitness landscape.

We then apply our method to a dataset of *E. coli* strains evolving in different
antibiotics, where a set of cross-resistance values to seven other antibiotics
was determined for each lineage at each time point of the adaptation process
[@iwasawa2022]. When comparing our method to a linear model based on principal
components, we find that the different evolved lineages separate much more
clearly in the geometry-informed latent space. Furthermore, in terms of
reconstruction accuracy, our two-dimensional nonlinear latent space is
equivalent to a five-dimensional linear latent space based on principal
components. Finally, to show that the information captured by the learned
nonlinear latent space is more predictive of the cross-resistance values, we
leave one of the eight antibiotics out during the construction of the latent
space, and then use this latent coordinates to predict the cross-resistance
values of the left-out antibiotic. The results show that the geometry-informed
two-dimensional latent space outperforms the linear model based on principal
components by a significant margin.

Our work can be viewed as a modern, data-driven implementation of Fisher's
geometric model of adaptation [@orr2005]. While Fisher conceptualized adaptation
as movement in a multidimensional phenotypic space, this framework has largely
remained theoretical due to the challenges of empirically reconstructing such
spaces. By leveraging geometry-aware variational autoencoders, we demonstrate
that it is possible to reconstruct the underlying phenotypic manifold directly
from fitness measurements across multiple environments. This approach suggests
it is possible to transform Fisher's geometric intuition from a conceptual tool
into an empirically grounded framework, where the dimensionality, topology, and
metric properties of the phenotypic space can be inferred from experimental data
rather than assumed a priori. The geometry-informed latent space we recover
provides a picture of the adaptive landscape as originally envisioned by Fisher
but with the mathematical sophistication afforded by modern deep-learning
methods.
