## Geometry-Informed Latent Space Reconstruction of Fitness Landscapes {#sec-fitness-landscapes}

With the ability to capture the underlying structure of the phenotypic space as
shown in @fig-04, it is natural to ask whether the RHVAE can be used to
reconstruct the underlying fitness landscapes. For this, we take advantage of
the fact that the RHVAE decoder represents a continuous function from latent
coordinates to fitness values in different environments. Scanning a grid of
latent coordinates allows us to evaluate the fitness landscape at any point in
the latent space for all three models shown in @fig-04. @fig-05 shows examples
of ground truth fitness landscapes, used to generate the data (first row), and
the resulting inferred fitness landscapes for the RHVAE, VAE, and PCA models
(second, third, and fourth rows, respectively). Qualitatively, we see that the
RHVAE is able to capture the underlying topography of the fitness landscapes,
where the number of peaks and their relative positions are similar to the ground
truth landscapes. Although the VAE model can also capture the general shape of
the fitness landscapes, the lack of a metric in this space---limiting the
predictions only to the local neighborhood of the training data---makes it
difficult to define where to trust the predictions of the model. The PCA model,
on the other hand, is not able to capture the underlying structure of the
fitness landscapes as there is a non-linear structure that cannot be captured by
a linear transformation.

![**Geometry-informed latent space enables accurate reconstruction of complex
fitness landscapes**. Comparison of ground truth and reconstructed fitness
landscapes across multiple environments. The first row shows examples of the
original simulated fitness landscapes used to generate the data. Subsequent rows
show reconstructions using the RHVAE (second row), VAE (third row), and PCA
(fourth row) models. The RHVAE accurately captures the underlying topography,
including the number and relative positions of fitness peaks. While the VAE
captures general landscape shapes, it lacks a geometric metric to define
prediction reliability regions. PCA fails to represent the non-linear structure
of the landscapes, demonstrating the limitations of linear dimensionality
reduction for complex fitness landscape
