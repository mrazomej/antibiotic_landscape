## Evolutionary Dynamics on Phenotype Space

Having defined a simple phenotype-fitness model, we now instantiate a set of
rules for evolutionary dynamics on this phenotypic space. We implement a model
that captures two key features of evolutionary processes: the tendency of
populations to move towards higher fitness and the constraints imposed by the
accessibility of different phenotypes. We frame evolution as a biased random
walk where each step is influenced by both the fitness landscape
$F(\underline{p})$ and the genotype-phenotype density $GP(\underline{p})$.

At each time step, the population can transition from its current phenotype
$\underline{p}$ to a new phenotype $\underline{p}'$, where the proposed
phenotype $\underline{p}'$ is drawn from a proposal distribution
$q(\underline{p}' \mid \underline{p})$. Whether this transition occurs depends
on both the relative fitness of the new phenotype and how easily it can be
reached through mutations. Specifically, the probability of accepting a
transition is given by

$$
P_{\text{accept}} = \min\left(
    1,
    \frac{F(\underline{p}')^\beta GP(\underline{p}')^\beta}
    {F(\underline{p})^\beta GP(\underline{p})^\beta}
\right),
$${#eq-acceptance-probability}

where $\beta$ is a parameter that controls the balance between selection and
drift. This parameter can be interpreted as the strength of selection---higher
values of $\beta$ lead to more deterministic trajectories that closely follow
fitness gradients, while lower values allow for more stochastic exploration of
the phenotype space. Detailed mathematical derivations and analysis of this
algorithm can be found in the Supplementary Materials (see @sec-metropolis).

This formulation captures several key aspects of evolution. First, transitions
to phenotypes with higher fitness are always accepted, reflecting the power of
natural selection. Second, even transitions to lower fitness phenotypes can
occur with some probability, capturing the role of genetic drift. Finally, the
$GP(\underline{p})$ term ensures that transitions are influenced by the
accessibility of phenotype---even a high-fitness phenotype is unlikely to be
reached if it requires extremely rare genetic variants. @fig-02(A, top) shows
some example trajectories of multiple lineages evolving over time on a simple
single-peaked fitness landscape. @fig-02(A, bottom) shows the fitness trajectory
of these evolving lineages over time. When we examine these same evolutionary
trajectories under different environmental conditions (@fig-02(B)), we observe
that, as expected, while the path through phenotype space remains fixed---since
it represents the adaptive walk on the selection environment in @fig-02(A)---the
fitness values we measure vary because each environment imposes its own unique
fitness landscape.

In what follows, we use synthetic data generated from this model, where ten
lineages (initial phenotype coordinates) in two replicates (different
instantiations of the random dynamics) evolve for 300 time steps on 50 different
fitness landscapes (different topologies). For each of these conditions, the
fitness in all other environments is also determined, giving a high-dimensional
dataset that we can use to validate the proposed data-driven method.

evolutionary dynamics on phenotype space. Each line represents the trajectory of
lineage as it evolves over time with crosses  and triangles denoting the initial
phenotypic coordinate of a few selected lineages. Note that trajectories tend to
move towards higher fitness values, avoiding low genotype-to-phenotype density
regions. Bottom: Fitness over time of the same trajectories shown above. (B) The
same trajectories shown in (A) overlaid on different fitness maps determined by
different environments. Although the phenotypic coordinates of the genotypes
remain the same (top panels) the resulting fitness readouts change as the
topology of the environments changes (bottom
