Over the last decade, evolutionary biology has begun a transition from a
primarily descriptive field aimed at understanding the history of life on Earth
to a predictive science forecasting and controlling adaptive trajectories of
evolving populations [@Lassig2017; @lassig2023a]. Such predictions have had
real-world consequences, from viral dynamics [@uksza2014] to cancer
immunotherapy [@luksza2017]. However, it is still unclear to what extent
evolutionary trajectories under different environmental pressures can be
predicted. Two main challenges make this question difficult to answer. First,
the vast number of genetic changes available to a population makes it impossible
to exhaustively sample and measure the phenotypic consequences of each mutation
[@louis2016]. Second, for most organisms but a few simple model systems, it is
unknown what the phenotypic changes driving adaptation are [*cite?*].

Nevertheless, an extensive body of empirical studies and theoretical work has
suggested that the dynamics of adaptation are highly constrained, making them
potentially predictable. From examples of enormous redundancy in the
genotype-phenotype map, making the same phenotype accessible through many
different genetic changes [@wagner2008; @louis2016], to examples of a limited
number of viable adaptive trajectories [@weinreich2006], reducing the number of
sequential changes that can lead to adaptation, the evidence is mounting that
there are general principles governing the dynamics of adaptation. Moreover,
recent theoretical work on the evolution of complex gene regulatory networks has
shown that the output space available to these networks to adapt to new tasks is
highly constrained [@kaneko2015;@furusawa2018;@sato2020;@sato2023].

Inspired by this body of work, we set out to develop a general computational
framework to assess the predictability of evolutionary trajectories. We consider
three main ingredients for a computational method to tackle this question: 
1.  The method should be able to take advantage of the data-rich landscape of
modern biology, where high-throughput fitness measurements are becoming
increasingly common [@kinsler2020;@maeda2020;@iwasawa2022].
2. It should be able to uncover the potentially hidden simplicity in the
structure of the high-dimensional datasets generated by these experiments by
projecting them in a principled way into a lower-dimensional space visualizable
by humans.
3. The generated low-dimensional map should be accompanied by the corresponding
geometric information on how the high-dimensional space is folded into the map,
making the distances on the map meaningful in the high-dimensional space.

Here, we present a computational method that fulfills these three requirements.
By implementing a geometry-aware variational autoencoder---a neural network
architecture that embeds high-dimensional data into a low-dimensional space
while simultaneously learning the geometric transformations that map the learned
low-dimensional space back into the high-dimensional space---and applying it to
data from a recent study on the evolution of cross-resistance to different
antibiotics in *E. coli* [@iwasawa2022], we show that adaptive trajectories in
the learned low-dimensional space are highly predictable.
