Elucidating the complex relationships between genotypes, phenotypes, and fitness
remains one of the fundamental challenges in evolutionary biology. Part of the
difficulty arises from the enormous number of possible genotypes and the lack of
understanding of the underlying phenotypic differences driving adaptation. Here,
we present a computational method that takes advantage of modern high-throughput
fitness measurements to learn a map from high-dimensional fitness profiles to a
low-dimensional latent space in a geometry-aware manner. When applied to
simulated adaptive dynamics, we show that the learned latent space retains
information about the underlying adaptive phenotypic space. Furthermore,
adaptive trajectories in the learned latent space become highly predictable as
the shortest path between the pre- and post-evolution points in latent space. We
then apply this method to a dataset of high-throughput fitness measurements of
*E. coli* under different antibiotic pressures and show that, again, adaptive
trajectories in the learned latent space are highly predictable, suggesting that
the method can serve as a powerful exploratory tool to uncover the underlying
structure of the phenotypic space in which adaptation unfolds.
