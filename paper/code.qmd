# Code Documentation

This section provides interactive code examples and demonstrations of the
computational methods used in our research on evolutionary landscapes and
phenotype-to-fitness maps.

## Available Notebooks

We provide several computational notebooks that showcase different aspects of
our methodology and analysis:

1. **[Evolutionary Dynamics Simulation](code/evolutionary_dynamics.qmd)** 
- Simulates the dynamics of populations evolving in a 2-dimensional phenotypic
space under various fitness landscapes and fixed mutational constraints. This
notebook demonstrates how populations navigate phenotypic space influenced by
both fitness gradients and genotype-phenotype density.

2. **[RHVAE on Simulated Data](code/rhvae_sim.qmd)** 
- Implements a Riemannian Hamiltonian Variational Autoencoder (RHVAE) to analyze
fitness profiles generated from evolutionary simulations. This notebook shows
how we can learn low-dimensional representations of high-dimensional fitness
data while preserving the geometric structure of the underlying phenotypic
space.

3. **[Bayesian Inference of IC₅₀ Values](code/iwasawa_bayesian_inference.qmd)**
- Performs Bayesian inference on the IC₅₀ values of antibiotic resistance
landscapes using experimental data. This notebook demonstrates model fitting of
dose-response curves using different parameterizations and implements outlier
detection techniques.

4. **[Metropolis-Kimura Evolution](code/metropolis_kimura_evolution.qmd)** 
- Explores a biologically motivated model of evolution combining elements of the
Metropolis-Hastings algorithm with Motoo Kimura's population genetics theory.
This model accounts separately for mutation accessibility and selection via
fixation probability.

5. **[Metropolis-Hastings Evolution](code/metropolis_hastings_evolution.qmd)** 
- Implements the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for simulating evolutionary
dynamics on fitness landscapes with mutational constraints.

## Running the Code

All notebooks can be run interactively if you have Julia installed with the
required packages. Each notebook is self-contained with detailed explanations,
mathematical background, and visualization of results.

### Required Packages

To run these notebooks, you'll need:

- **Data Processing**: `DataFrames`, `CSV`, `DimensionalData`
- **Scientific Computing**: `LinearAlgebra`, `StatsBase`, `Distributions`, `LsqFit`
- **Bayesian Inference**: `Turing`
- **Deep Learning**: `Flux`, `AutoEncoderToolkit`
- **Visualization**: `CairoMakie`, `ColorSchemes`
