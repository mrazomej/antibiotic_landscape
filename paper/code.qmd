# Code Documentation

This section provides interactive code examples and demonstrations of the computational methods used in our research on evolutionary landscapes.

## Available Notebooks

We've provided several Jupyter notebooks to help you understand our analysis workflow:

1. [Evolutionary Dynamics](code/evolutionary_dynamics.qmd) - Simulating evolutionary dynamics in a 2D phenotypic space.
2. [RHVAE on Simulated Data](code/rhvae_sim.qmd) - Training a Riemannian Hamiltonian Variational Autoencoder (RHVAE) on simulated data.

## Running the Code

All notebooks can be run interactively if you have Julia installed with the required packages. Each notebook is self-contained with the necessary package imports.

### Required Packages

- CairoMakie
- DataFrames
- CSV
- Statistics
- StatsBase
- Other specialized packages as needed

Click on any of the notebooks in the sidebar to explore the code in detail.
