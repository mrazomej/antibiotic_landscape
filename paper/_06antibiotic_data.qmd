## Evolutionary Dynamics of Antibiotic Resistance in Latent Space

Having shown how the RHVAE can capture the underlying structure of the
phenotypic space, we now turn to the application of the model to the analysis of
antibiotic adaptation dynamics. We use the data from @iwasawa2022 where the
authors evolved different *E. coli* strains on three different antibiotics:
kanamycin (KM), norfloxacin (NFLX), and tetracycline (TET). For this, they used
a multi-well plate format where the rows contained a gradient of different
antibiotic concentrations, as depicted in @fig-06(A). Every day, a fresh plate
with the same arrangement of antibiotics was inoculated with cells from the well
in the evolving condition with the highest concentration of antibiotic that
still allowed growth. This process was repeated every day for 27 days.
@fig-06(B) shows the raw data output from one of the experiments. The optical
density is plotted as a function of the antibiotic concentration, obtaining the
expected sigmoidal curve. Since this particular example shows data from
evolution in the antibiotic being used as the $x$-axis, we can see how, as
expected, the sigmoidal curve shifts to the right as the population evolves
increasing resistance to the antibiotic over time. From these titration curves,
we can use Bayesian inference to extract the value of the antibiotic
concentration at which the optical density is 50% of the maximum value. This
value---known as the *antibiotic $IC_{50}$*---is a measure of the antibiotic
resistance of the evolved strains (see Supplementary Material for more details).

@fig-06(C) shows the time trajectories of the $IC_{50}$ in all eight antibiotics
for all cultures evolved in TET. Over time, all lineages increase their
$IC_{50}$ in TET; however, the trend for all other antibiotics is more complex.
Following the same approach as in @fig-04, @fig-06(D) shows the resulting latent
spaces for PCA, VAE, and RHVAE trained on the $IC_{50}$ values for all eight
antibiotics. Each color represents a lineage evolved on a different antibiotic.
These projections show that the latent coordinates for different lineages are
more disentangled in the nonlinear latent spaces than in PCA. Moreover, the
rightmost panel shows that in terms of reconstruction error, RHVAE shows the
lowest error---comparable to that of a 5-dimensional PCA.

salicylate (SS)) for lineages evolved in tetracycline, demonstrating direct
resistance increase in the selection antibiotic and complex collateral effects
in other antibiotics. Error bars represent the 95% credible region as obtained
via Bayesian inference (see Supplementary Material) (D) Latent space projections

colors representing different evolution conditions, showing improved
disentanglement of lineages in nonlinear latent spaces and superior
reconstruction accuracy of RHVAE compared to other dimensionality reduction
methods. Different colors represent different lineages evolved in different
antibiotics. The rightmost panel shows the reconstruction error of the three
methods as a function of the number of PCs used for dimensionality
reduction.](./fig/main/fig06_v02_compiled){#fig-06}
