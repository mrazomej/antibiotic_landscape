\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

Over the last decade, evolutionary biology has begun a transition from a
primarily descriptive field aimed at understanding the history of life
on Earth to a predictive science forecasting and controlling adaptive
trajectories of evolving populations \autocite{Lassig2017,lassig2023a}.
Such predictions have had real-world consequences, from viral dynamics
\autocite{uksza2014} to cancer immunotherapy \autocite{luksza2017}.
However, it is still unclear to what extent evolutionary trajectories
under different environmental pressures can be predicted. Two main
challenges make this question difficult to answer. First, the vast
number of genetic changes available to a population makes it impossible
to exhaustively sample and measure the phenotypic consequences of each
mutation \autocite{louis2016}. Second, for most organisms but a few
simple model systems, it is unknown what the phenotypic changes driving
adaptation are {[}\emph{cite?}{]}.

Nevertheless, an extensive body of empirical studies and theoretical
work has suggested that the dynamics of adaptation are highly
constrained, making them potentially predictable. From examples of
enormous redundancy in the genotype-phenotype map, making the same
phenotype accessible through many different genetic changes
\autocite{wagner2008,louis2016}, to examples of a limited number of
viable adaptive trajectories \autocite{weinreich2006}, reducing the
number of sequential changes that can lead to adaptation, the evidence
is mounting that there are general principles governing the dynamics of
adaptation. Moreover, recent theoretical work on the evolution of
complex gene regulatory networks has shown that the output space
available to these networks to adapt to new tasks is highly constrained
\autocite{kaneko2015,furusawa2018,sato2020,sato2023}.

Inspired by this body of work, we set out to develop a general
computational framework to assess the predictability of evolutionary
trajectories. We consider three main ingredients for a computational
method to tackle this question: 1. The method should be able to take
advantage of the data-rich landscape of modern biology, where
high-throughput fitness measurements are becoming increasingly common
\autocite{kinsler2020,maeda2020,iwasawa2022}. 2. The method should be
able to uncover the potentially hidden simplicity in the structure of
the high-dimensional datasets generated by these experiments by
projecting them in a principled way into a lower-dimensional space
visualizable by humans. 3. The generated low-dimensional map should be
accompanied by the corresponding geometric information on how the
high-dimensional space is folded into the map, making the distances on
the map meaningful in the high-dimensional space.
