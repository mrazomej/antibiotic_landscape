## Geometry-Informed Latent Space Captures the Underlying Phenotypic Space

As described in the Supplementary Material, we trained three models on the
simulated profiles depicted in [@fig-02] for comparison: A linear model (via
PCA), a vanilla VAE, and an RHVAE. Each of these models allows us to project the
high-dimensional fitness profiles into a low-dimensional latent space.
Nevertheless, none of the resulting latent spaces need to be aligned to the
ground truth phenotype as they were constructed with no information about the
relative coordinates in phenotype space. To visually compare whether the
resulting latent coordinates for the simulated data preserve the general
structure of the phenotype space, we aligned each latent space to the ground
truth phenotype space using Procrustes analysis (see Supplementary Material).
@fig-04(A) shows the resulting latent space coordinates colored by the lineage
of the simulated profiles. Qualitatively, we observe that, although all models
partially capture the relative positions of each lineage with respect to the
others, the RHVAE-derived latent space appears to preserve the local structure
of the phenotype space better than the other two models. Moreover, when looking
at the commonly-used PCA-derived latent space, we might be misled into believing
that the two highlighted points (diamond markers) are genotypes with very
similar phenotypic effects, when in fact they are extremely different, as
captured by the non-linear latent spaces. Overall, the RHVAE-derived latent
space preserves the pairwise distances between the genotypes better than the
other two models (see Supplementary Material).

Having visually confirmed that the RHVAE-derived latent space preserves the
structure of the phenotype space better than the other two models, we now
investigate whether these latent coordinates also contain enough information to
reconstruct the fitness profiles. To this end, we compare the reconstruction
accuracy of the RHVAE to that of the PCA and VAE models. @fig-04(B) shows the
mean squared error (MSE) of the reconstructed fitness profiles as a function of
the number of latent dimensions included in the PCA model. We observe that the
vanilla 2D-VAE model achieves a reconstruction error equivalent to that of an
eight-dimensional PCA model. In contrast, the 2D-RHVAE consistently outperforms
the other two models, achieving a reconstruction error that is on par with that
of a ten-dimensional PCA model. This further highlights the ability of the RHVAE
to capture the underlying nonlinear structure of the phenotype space while
maintaining high reconstruction accuracy.

One of the main advantages of the RHVAE is its ability to learn a metric tensor
that captures the local geometry of the latent space. A way to visualize this
gemoetric information is to plot the so-called metric volume, defined as the
determinant of the metric tensor at each point in the latent space. Intuitively,
the determinant of the metric tensor at a given point can be interpreted as the
level of deformation of the latent space at that point. Small values of the
metric volume indicate that the latent space is locally flat, while large values
indicate that the latent space is locally curved. @fig-04(C, left) shows the
metric volume of the latent space derived from the RHVAE model. The lighter the
color, the larger the metric volume, and thus the larger the local deformation.
When overlaying the points over this metric volume (@fig-04(C, right)), we
observe that everything outside the data cloud is locally curved. Knowing that
neural networks are not able to generalize well outside the data cloud, having
this feature is particularly nice because the curvature in the latent space
defines the regions where the trained model is able to make accurate
predictions. Moreover, we note that regions of high curvature within the data
cloud exactly correspond to the regions of low genotype-phenotype density we
imposed in the simulation. This suggests that the geometric information encoded
in the metric tensor is able to capture the underlying structure of the
phenotypic space.
