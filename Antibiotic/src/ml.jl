    `step_scheduler(epoch, epoch_change, learning_rates)`

Simple function to define different learning rates at specified epochs.

# Arguments
- `epoch::Int`: Epoch at which to define learning rate.
- `epoch_change::Vector{<:Int}`: Number of epochs at which to change learning
  rate. It must include the initial learning rate!
- `learning_rates::Vector{<:AbstractFloat}`: Learning rate value for the epoch
  range. Must be the same length as `epoch_change`

# Returns
- `η::Abstr`
